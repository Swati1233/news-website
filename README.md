## Running React on Replit

# News Application

## Overview
This is a React-based news application that fetches and displays the latest headlines using the **News API**.

The application also includes robust error handling to inform users if there is an issue fetching the news.

## Features
- **Latest News**: Fetches the latest news headlines using the News API.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for news articles by title or description.
- **Category Filtering**: Users can filter articles by different categories such as Business, Entertainment, Health, Science, Sports, Technology, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate error messages if there is an issue fetching the news.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is built with a responsive layout to ensure compatibility with different screen sizes.

###Notes
This project is built using Replitâ€™s environment, so there is no need for manual setup of Node.js or additional development environments.
If running the project locally, you'll need to have Node.js installed and run the following commands:

npm install    # Install dependencies
npm start      # Run the application
